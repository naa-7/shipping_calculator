The idea of this project is to calculate the cost of different ways of shipping; ground shipping, premium shipping,

drone shipping. Also, the program can calculate the cheapest option of shipping. Zenity is used by the program 

prompting the user to input the weight and option of shipping in order to calculate the cost. Once the calculation 

is accomplished, then the result is displayed for the user on Zenity.

### To run the program

    $ python shipping_cost_calculator.py
